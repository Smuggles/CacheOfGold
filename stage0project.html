        <h2> The Basics of the Web </h2>
  <P>
        The World Wide Web is a composition of HTML documents. HTML stands for
        "<em>Hypertext Markup Language</em>" and is the language that is translated
        from servers into the internet to your browsing client. Common themes in HTML
         include things such as URL's, font changes, bolding, and web applications.

        <h2> Basic HTML Elements </h2>
  <p>
        HTML elements are very important in the fact that they are what we use
         to translate our content into the web page. This can vary from things such
         as bolding or italicizing text, to hyperlinking images or text.
         We assign values to the elements through "<em>Tags</em>", some common tags
         follow as such:<br>
          < b > (Bold)<br>< em > (Italicization)<br>< a href="url" > (Hyperlinking)<br>
         < img src="url" > (Images)
  </p>
        <h2> Types of HTML Elements </h2>
  <p>
        There are two types of HTML elements that define how the line is ran,
         inline and box format. Box elements or container elements typically
          create a box around the inscribed element, containing the space. While
          on the other hand things such as inline, don't surround it but rather go
          to the following line afterwards, much like pressing enter while on a
          word document.
